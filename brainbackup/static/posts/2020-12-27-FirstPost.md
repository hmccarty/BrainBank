### History and Motivations
If you're reading this, then I finally deployed this project to Heroku! This
site has been a ongoing project for me since August, usually working on it for
a few hours every month or so. My main motivation was to begin archiving
interesting information I may pick up over the next few years.

### Technical Details
As I mentioned on the home page, I would hardly consider myself a 
web-developer. That is most of my reasoning in opting for a simpler (but
more customizable) site where I fully understand the inner-workings. At
the moment, it is powered by the Flask microframework. I am using an
sqlite database to store the related post content and support the tagging
system.

### Future Work
Most obviously, I intend on adding content as I explore new topics. As far
as the site however, I have the following list of features which I hope to
knockout sometime in the future:
- Post searching by name
- Video archiving support
- Improved workflow for post deployment

For now though, we'll take things one step at a time. If you don't hear
from me in the next few months, then assume this has been another
project lost to lack of time.

See ya!
